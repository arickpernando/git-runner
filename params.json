It works by invoking `git-runner` through `hooks/post-update` in your remote Git repository.\r\n\r\n[Demonstration Video, Using git-runner to perform automatic deploys](http://ascii.io/a/1349)\r\n\r\nConfiguration for git-runner is read from a pre-determined file within the repository (at this time, that file is config/deploy.rb but this will soon be configurable). Any instructions detected are then processed and ran.\r\n\r\nInstructions are contained within `lib/git-runner/instructions`. By default the instructions contained here and only used for support purposes, real functionality is abstracted into separate gems (at this time the only real instuction is deploy).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n    $ gem install git-runner\r\n\r\n## Install any additional modules (you'll want to do this to get any real functionality)\r\n\r\n### Deploy using Capistrano\r\n[https://github.com/JamesBrooks/git-runner-deploy](https://github.com/JamesBrooks/git-runner-deploy)\r\n\r\n    gem install git-runner-deploy\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nSymlink `hooks/post-update` to `git-runner`, or if `post-update` is already in use modify it to run `git-runner` with the arguments supplied to the hook.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nConfiguration can be overwritten through a YAML file at either `/etc/git-runner.yml` or `$HOME/.git-runner.yml`. The current configuration options are:\r\n\r\n  * **git_executable** (default: '/usr/bin/env git')\r\n  * **instruction_file** (default: 'config/deploy.rb')\r\n  * **instruction_prefix** (default: '# GitRunner:')\r\n  * **tmp_directory** (default: '/tmp/git-runner')\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5. Create new Pull Request\r\n","name":"GitRunner","google":""}
